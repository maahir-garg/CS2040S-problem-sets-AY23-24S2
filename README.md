## Introduction

This repository contains my personal solutions to the problem sets assigned in the CS2040S course. Each problem set focuses on different aspects of data structures and algorithms, providing a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.

## Course Overview

**CS2040S: Data Structures and Algorithms**

The CS2040S course is designed to provide an in-depth understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms. Topics covered include:

- Arrays and Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Hash Tables
- Trees and Graphs
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms

## Problem Sets

Below is a list of the problem sets solved in this repository:

1. **PS_1**: Shift Register
2. **PS_2**: Load Balancing
3. **PS_3**: Sorting Detective
4. **PS_4**: ScapeGoat Trees
5. **PS_5**: ScapeGoat Trees, Part 2
6. **PS_6**: Markov Model
7. **PS_7_1**: Mazes Part 1
8. **PS_7_2**: Mazes Part 2
9. **PS_7_3**: Mazes Part 3
10. **PS_8**: Traveling Salesman

Each problem set is contained within its own directory and includes the problem statement, solution code, and any additional notes or explanations.
